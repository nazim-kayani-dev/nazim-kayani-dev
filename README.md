# Hi there, I'm Nazim!

I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of Melbourne passionate about building robust, scalable applications and solving complex problems with clean code.

My primary interest lies in full-stack development and machine learning. I enjoy working on everything from frontend design (using JavaScript and Figma) to building and training models with libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn.

I'm also actively expanding my skills in cloud and DevOps tools, including Docker and AWS.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
You can see my best work in my pinned repositories below, including:

Pinochle Card Game: A fully-featured Java application built with a focus on OOP principles and design patterns.

Traffic Sign Classifier: A Python project that compares a CNN (TensorFlow) and an SVM (Scikit-learn) for image classification.
